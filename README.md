# This is a comparison between Plotnine and Plotly graphs.
## Plotly is an interactive data visualization library that allows you to the create highly customizable and shareable charts, graphs, and dashboards for web and analytical applications. I'm sure we are already familiar with Plotnine though.
## There are 2 Plotnine graphs that will be shown, and 2 Plotly graphs with more uses than the 2 Plotnine graphs will be shown. A third custom Plotly graph showcasing what Plotly can do will be shown as well.
### Before running the imports, be sure to have installed the following packages:

Install Plotly (for Plotly and its dataframes)

`pip install plotly`

Install Plotnine (for Plotnine and its dataframes)

`pip install plotnine`

Install Numpy (for one specific Plotly graph)

`pip install numpy`

After that, download the file and you should be good to go!
